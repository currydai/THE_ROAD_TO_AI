\section{Federated Learning}
Federated learning (FL) trains models across a federation of edge devices or organizations without centralizing raw data. Let $\mathcal{K} = \{1, \ldots, K\}$ denote clients with local datasets $\mathcal{D}_k$ and loss $\ell(\mathbf{w}; \mathcal{D}_k)$. The global objective is
\begin{equation}
  \min_{\mathbf{w}} f(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} p_k \, \ell(\mathbf{w}; \mathcal{D}_k), \quad p_k = \frac{|\mathcal{D}_k|}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} |\mathcal{D}_j|}.
\end{equation}
FL addresses challenges such as statistical heterogeneity, intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, and strict privacy requirements.

\subsection{System Architecture and Communication Patterns}
The canonical FL architecture involves a coordinator aggregating model updates from clients. Communication rounds alternate between broadcasting the global model $\mathbf{w}^{(t)}$ and aggregating client updates $\Delta \mathbf{w}_k^{(t)}$. Figure~\ref{fig:fl_architecture} conceptually illustrates the pipeline.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Synchronous orchestration:} All participating clients upload updates per round; stragglers can slow convergence.
  \item \textbf{Asynchronous orchestration:} The server updates the model as soon as client gradients arrive, requiring staleness-aware optimization.
  \item \textbf{Hierarchical federation:} Multi-tier architectures aggregate updates at intermediate gateways before reaching a cloud aggregator, reducing latency and improving scalability.
\end{itemize}
Resource-aware scheduling selects clients based on compute capability, data freshness, and fairness constraints.

\subsection{Optimization Algorithms}
FedAvg performs local stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for $E$ epochs before averaging:
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} p_k \, \mathbf{w}_k^{(t+1)}, \quad \mathbf{w}_k^{(t+1)} = \mathbf{w}^{(t)} - \eta \sum_{\tau=1}^{E} \nabla \ell(\mathbf{w}_k^{(\tau)}; \xi_k^\tau).
\end{equation}
Variants address heterogeneity and communication efficiency:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{FedProx:} Adds proximal term $\frac{\mu}{2}\|\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{w}^{(t)}\|_2^2$ to stabilize updates under non-i.i.d. data.
  \item \textbf{SCAFFOLD:} Maintains control variates to reduce client-drift bias.
  \item \textbf{FedNova and FedOpt:} Normalize updates or leverage adaptive server optimizers (e.g., FedAdam, FedYogi) to accelerate convergence.
  \item \textbf{Communication compression:} Employs quantization, sparsification, and error feedback to reduce payload.
\end{itemize}
Convergence rates are analyzed via bounded gradient dissimilarity $\mathbb{E}\|\nabla f_k - \nabla f\|^2 \le \beta^2$, with theoretical guarantees contingent on bounded variance and Lipschitz smoothness.

\subsection{Privacy, Security, and Trust}
Privacy-preserving techniques ensure that model updates do not leak sensitive information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Secure aggregation:} Clients encrypt updates using additive masking, enabling the server to learn only the sum.
  \item \textbf{Differential privacy (DP):} Adds noise to gradients. Client-level DP bounds membership inference via $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ guarantees. The noise scale $\sigma$ satisfies $\sigma \ge \frac{\sqrt{2 \log(1.25/\delta)}}{\varepsilon}$ when using Gaussian mechanisms.
  \item \textbf{Homomorphic encryption:} Allows aggregation on encrypted updates at higher computational cost.
\end{itemize}
Adversarial robustness addresses poisoning (malicious updates) and backdoor attacks. Defense strategies include anomaly detection via cosine similarity, robust aggregation (Krum, Trimmed Mean, Median), and certified defenses using influence functions.

\subsection{Applications and Case Studies}
FL underpins privacy-sensitive domains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mobile on-device intelligence:} Keyboard prediction, wake-word detection, and personalized speech recognition.
  \item \textbf{Healthcare consortia:} Cross-institutional medical imaging analysis where raw patient data cannot leave hospitals.
  \item \textbf{Finance and insurance:} Collaborative fraud detection across institutions while respecting regulatory boundaries.
\end{itemize}
Emerging use cases include federated foundation models, cross-silo collaboration between corporations, and interplanetary learning for autonomous space probes.

\subsection{Open Challenges}
Key research directions include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Heterogeneity:} Handling non-IID data, unbalanced participation, and concept drift in long-running systems.
  \item \textbf{Personalization:} Balancing global generalization with client-specific adaptations via meta-learning or model mixture approaches.
  \item \textbf{Incentive design:} Game-theoretic mechanisms that reward honest participation and truthful reporting.
  \item \textbf{Regulatory compliance:} Formalizing legal audit trails, data provenance, and consent management within FL pipelines.
\end{itemize}

\section{Self-Supervised Learning}
Self-supervised learning (SSL) leverages intrinsic structure in unlabeled data to learn transferable representations. Pretext tasks provide pseudo-labels, enabling downstream fine-tuning with minimal supervision.

\subsection{Contrastive Objectives}
Contrastive methods maximize agreement between augmented views. Given anchor $\mathbf{x}$, positive $\mathbf{x}^+$, and negatives $\{\mathbf{x}_j^-\}$, the InfoNCE loss is
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{InfoNCE}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\operatorname{sim}(g(f(\mathbf{x})), g(f(\mathbf{x}^+)))/\tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\operatorname{sim}(g(f(\mathbf{x})), g(f(\mathbf{x}_j^-)))/\tau)},
\end{equation}
where $\operatorname{sim}$ is cosine similarity and $\tau$ is temperature. Augmentation diversity (cropping, color jitter, mixup) is critical.

\subsection{Non-Contrastive and Masked Modeling}
Bootstrap approaches (BYOL, SimSiam) rely on momentum encoders and predictor heads without negative samples. Collapse avoidance emerges from architectural asymmetry and stop-gradient operations. Masked autoencoders (MAE) reconstruct masked patches using asymmetric encoders/decoders, optimizing
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{MAE}} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{M}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{M}} \| \hat{\mathbf{x}}_i - \mathbf{x}_i \|_2^2,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{M}$ is the masked patch set. Token-level masking extends to speech (HuBERT), protein sequences (ESM), and multimodal inputs.

\subsection{Architectural Choices}
Vision transformers (ViT) dominate vision SSL due to flexibility in patch embeddings and global attention. In speech and text, convolutional front-ends feed into transformers or conformers. Projection heads (MLPs), batch normalization, and whitening control representation collapse. Multi-task pretext learning integrates clustering, rotation prediction, and context autoregression.

\subsection{Transfer and Evaluation}
Linear probing assesses representation quality via a frozen encoder and linear classifier. Full fine-tuning measures adaptability. k-NN evaluation, few-shot tasks, and robustness against distribution shifts provide complementary signals. For multimodal SSL (e.g., CLIP), cross-modal retrieval and zero-shot classification quantify alignment via cosine similarity thresholds.

\subsection{Scaling Laws and Efficiency}
Scaling studies reveal power-law relationships between data size, model width, and downstream error. Efficient SSL focuses on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Memory optimization:} Gradient checkpointing, large-batch optimization with LARS/LAMB, and mixed-precision training.
  \item \textbf{Negative sampling efficiency:} Memory banks, MoCo queues, and feature reuse within micro-batches.
  \item \textbf{Curriculum masking:} Adaptive masking ratios that increase difficulty over training steps.
\end{itemize}
Theoretical advances analyze mutual information estimation, invariance-vs-equivariance trade-offs, and the role of implicit regularization in SSL.

\subsection{Applications}
SSL underpins foundation models in vision, language, audio, robotics, and scientific domains. Examples include CLIP for image-text alignment, wav2vec for speech recognition, and protein language models for structure prediction. Self-supervised world models empower model-based reinforcement learning by predicting latent dynamics.

\section{Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)}
Artificial General Intelligence aspires to develop systems with versatile cognitive abilities across domains, comparable to or surpassing human intelligence. AGI research synthesizes machine learning, neuroscience, cognitive science, and philosophy.

\subsection{Definitions and Capability Taxonomies}
AGI definitions vary: Some emphasize \emph{general competence} across tasks, others stress \emph{goal-directed adaptability}. Capability taxonomies categorize systems by autonomy, generality, and efficiency. Legg and Hutter's universal intelligence measure integrates discounted performance across environments:
\begin{equation}
  \Upsilon(\pi) = \sum_{\mu \in \mathcal{E}} 2^{-K(\mu)} V_\mu^\pi,
\end{equation}
where $V_\mu^\pi$ is the value achieved by policy $\pi$ in environment $\mu$ and $K(\mu)$ is Kolmogorov complexity. Practical proxies include model coverage, reasoning benchmarks, and embodied decision-making tasks.

\subsection{Architectural Paradigms}
Progress toward AGI explores several paradigms:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Scaling deep learning:} Large transformer-based foundation models with mixture-of-experts, retrieval augmentation, and tool-use capabilities.
  \item \textbf{Neuro-symbolic hybrids:} Integrating differentiable perception with symbolic planning, logical reasoning, and program synthesis.
  \item \textbf{Embodied cognition:} Agents interacting with simulated or real environments (robotics, virtual worlds) to ground language and concepts.
  \item \textbf{Meta-learning and continual adaptation:} Systems that rapidly learn new tasks from minimal examples while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
\end{itemize}
Algorithmic innovations include modular architectures, world models, and decision transformers that unify planning and reinforcement learning.

\subsection{Safety, Alignment, and Governance}
AGI development raises safety and governance challenges:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Outer alignment:} Ensuring the specified objective aligns with human values, often via inverse reinforcement learning, preference modeling, or constitutional AI.
  \item \textbf{Inner alignment:} Verifying that the learned model's internal objectives match the intended goal, mitigating deceptive behavior.
  \item \textbf{Interpretability and verification:} Mechanistic interpretability, neuron activation analysis, and formal specifications increase transparency.
  \item \textbf{Governance frameworks:} International cooperation, policy guardrails, auditing standards, and incident reporting protocols.
\end{itemize}
Risk assessment introduces metrics such as expected utility bounds and probabilistic safety constraints $\mathbb{P}(\text{catastrophe}) \le \delta$. Alignment research also evaluates reward hacking and specification gaming scenarios.

\subsection{Evaluation and Benchmarking}
No single benchmark captures general intelligence. Composite evaluation suites combine reasoning (MMLU, BIG-bench), interaction (ARC, MineRL), and social simulations. Meta-evaluation studies compare benchmark correlations to real-world task success. Human-in-the-loop testing, red teaming, and adversarial prompting uncover failure modes.

\end{table}

\subsection{Roadmaps and Open Problems}
Key questions driving AGI research include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sample-efficient learning:} Achieving strong performance with limited supervision through priors, compositional modeling, and world knowledge.
  \item \textbf{Robust generalization:} Maintaining reliability under distribution shifts, adversarial contexts, and novel tasks.
  \item \textbf{Value learning:} Eliciting, representing, and aligning with diverse human preferences across cultures.
  \item \textbf{Societal integration:} Understanding macroeconomic impacts, labor displacement, and ethical deployment.
\end{itemize}
Cross-disciplinary collaboration with cognitive science, neuroscience, and ethics is essential to bridge conceptual gaps and develop comprehensive evaluation protocols.
